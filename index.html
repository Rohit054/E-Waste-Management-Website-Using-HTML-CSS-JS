          It was found that only 23% of the workers know the meaning of
          E-waste.Only 28% of them were aware of the harmful effects of e-waste.

      <br />
      <p>
        Welcome to our E-Waste Awareness section, where we aim to educate and
        raise awareness about the importance of responsible e-waste management.
        Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a growing concern due to its adverse
        impact on the environment and human health. When improperly disposed of,
        e-waste releases hazardous substances such as lead, mercury, and cadmium
        into the environment, contaminating our air, soil, and water sources.
        This pollution poses significant risks to ecosystems, wildlife, and
        human populations. By promoting proper e-waste disposal and recycling,
        we can mitigate these risks and contribute to a cleaner and healthier
        planet. Through informative articles, tips, and resources, we will
        explore the environmental consequences of e-waste, the benefits of
        recycling, and practical steps individuals and businesses can take to
        reduce their e-waste footprint. Together, we can make a positive impact
        by raising awareness and fostering a culture of responsible e-waste
        management. Join us on this journey to protect our environment and build
        a sustainable future.

      <h3 class="headings">About Recycling process</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our recycling process for e-waste is designed to ensure the responsible
        and efficient handling of electronic devices. Once the e-waste is
        collected, we carefully dismantle each item, separating different
        components and materials. This allows us to sort and identify recyclable
        materials such as metals, plastics, and glass. Our trained technicians
        use specialized equipment to process these materials and extract
        valuable resources. Metals like copper, aluminum, and gold are extracted
        for reuse, reducing the need for new mining and minimizing the
        environmental impact. Plastics are also recycled, helping to conserve
        energy and reduce the demand for new plastic production. Additionally,
        hazardous substances such as lead and mercury are safely disposed of
        according to environmental regulations. Our recycling process follows
        strict industry standards and ensures the protection of personal data
        through secure data destruction methods. By recycling e-waste, we
        contribute to the circular economy, conserving resources, reducing
        landfill waste, and promoting a sustainable future for generations to
        come.
